> Dynamics. Pixologic ZBrush introduces a dynamics system that allows any surface to contract, expand, inflate, or drape with gravity. You can use masking to anchor part of the mesh and create a point of interest, or use a mask to create a unique interaction that can allow a surface to curl in on itself. Create realistic folds of fabric - even on a low-resolution plane.

> Controlled fabric sculpting. Pixologic ZBrush introduces special brushes that utilize a dynamics system for unique opportunities to interact with the fabric surface. For example, you can choose where creases will lie or simply grab the geometry to move it freely in the workspace and create creases in real time.

> [!TIP]
> Revised Dynamic Subdivision. Dynamic Subdivision provides a working preview of your subdivision levels without actually increasing the base number of polygons. This feature is now developed further, allowing you to add adjustable thickness to any single piece of flat geometry. A piece of geometry can also be added to each polygon as a fully interactive instance.
