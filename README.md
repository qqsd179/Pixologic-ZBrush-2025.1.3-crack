# FREE Pixologic ZBrush 2023 2024 2025 🚀🎉
Dynamics. Pixologic ZBrush introduces a dynamics system that allows any surface to contract, expand, inflate, or drape with gravity. You can use masking to anchor part of the mesh and create a point of interest, or use a mask to create a unique interaction that can allow a surface to curl in on itself. Create realistic folds of fabric - even on a low-resolution plane.
